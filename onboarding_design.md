# Onboarding Process Design: Mutual Tasks PWA

## Overview
This 3-page onboarding flow is designed to highlight the unique value propositions of the "Mutual Tasks" app: **Collaboration**, **AI-Assisted Efficiency**, and **Gamified Progress**.

The goal is to transition users from a "passive observer" to an "active participant" by the end of the 3rd swipe.

## Page 1: The "Mutual" Advantage
**Theme:** Collaboration & Shared Context
**Goal:** Differentiate the app from standard "solo" to-do lists immediately.

### Content
*   **Headline:** Accomplish More, Together.
*   **Sub-headline:** Transform personal goals into shared victories.
*   **Description:**
    > "Don't just track tasks—share them. Create **Private Projects** for close collaboration or **Public Projects** to build communities. Invite friends instantly by handle (`@username`) and keep everyone in sync."

### Visual Concepts
*   **Graphic:** A split-screen animation.
    *   *Left:* A single user avatar with a personal list.
    *   *Right:* It expands to show multiple avatars, a "Project Joined" badge, and tasks being assigned to different people.
*   **Key Feature Highlight:** Project Types (Public/Private) & Team Members.

## Page 2: The "Smart" Engine
**Theme:** AI Power & Habit Building
**Goal:** Reveal powerful features hidden within the Task Form.

### Content
*   **Headline:** Automate Your Routine.
*   **Sub-headline:** AI-powered clarity and flexible habit tracking.
*   **Description:**
    > "Stuck on details? Tap the **AI Sparkles (✨)** to instantly write rich task descriptions. Building a habit? Turn any task into an **Activity Series** with completely custom schedules that fit your life."

### Visual Concepts
*   **Graphic:** A focused interaction loop.
    *   *Action:* A cursor taps the ✨ icon next to a task title "Running".
    *   *Result:* A rich description auto-populates, and a "Weekly Recurrence" badge slides in.
*   **Key Feature Highlight:** AI Generation Button & Custom Recurrence Patterns.

## Page 3: The "Effort" Tracker
**Theme:** Gamification & Insight
**Goal:** Explain the "Difficulty Rating" modal so users engaged with it rather than skipping it.

### Content
*   **Headline:** Track Effort, Not Just Ticks.
*   **Sub-headline:** Measure how hard you work, not just what you finish.
*   **Description:**
    > "Completion is just the start. Rate the **Difficulty** of every task you finish to track your true workload. Keep your **Consistency Streak** alive and watch your productivity light up your personal Heatmap."

### Visual Concepts
*   **Graphic:** The "Reward" Moment.
    *   *Action:* User checks off a task.
    *   *Reaction:* A "Difficulty Rating" star appears, the user selects "Challenging", and a calendar square turns bright green/purple.
*   **Key Feature Highlight:** Post-completion Rating Modal & Profile Heatmap.

## Calls to Action (CTA)
